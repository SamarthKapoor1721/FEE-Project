            <h1>Why Expenso?</h1>
            <div>Some often think that tracking expenses is trivial and difficult to do consistently. In fact, its
                benefits are substantial. One being help you to be wiser in managing expenses. In addition, tracking
                your expenses is useful for assets and wealth. To learn the benefits of tracking your expenses</div>

            <div>
                <h1>How does it help?</h1>
            </div>
            <div>Keeping track of expenses is also useful in knowing the average amount of daily, weekly, and monthly
                expenses. So, if you spend more than normal, it will be easy to evaluate it. In the end, your money will
                be used for necessary items only and can even be allocated for saving or investment.If you are clueless
                about how much is your inflow and how much you are spending, you will not know at the end of the month
                what happened to your money. An expense tracker helps you figure out what is happening to your money,
                and whether you can afford something you want.Remember, emergencies come when you least expect. Hence,
                if you donâ€™t have money stashed away for a rainy day, you will end up borrowing from family and friends.
                This way you could get into debt that will be difficult to pay back due to your poor money management
                skills.</div>
